particle_filter.cpp
  ParticleFilter::init
    * Set number of particles
	* Initialize all particles using x, y, theta and uncertainties
	* Initialize all weights to 1
  ParticleFilter::prediction
    * Add measurements to each particle with added gauss noise
  ParticleFilter::dataAssociation
    * Find the predicted measurement that is closest to each observed measurement
	* Assign each observed measurement to the closest predicted measurement.
  ParticleFilter::resample
    * Resample particles with replacement with probability equal to their weights
